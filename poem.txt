Life


An ugly situation devoid of meaning
Where people fight for living
With no real purpose
Yet full of hate and love
Love 
We live because of it
Without it life will be empty
O What about hate
A one that has a stronger feeling than love
As they say, there is a thin line between hate and love
Do not understimate negative feeling and their power
